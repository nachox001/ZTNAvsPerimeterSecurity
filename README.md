# Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) vs Perimeter-Based Security

## Overview
This project explores the effectiveness of Zero Trust Network Architecture (ZTNA) compared to traditional perimeter-based security models. It demonstrates ZTNA's ability to mitigate cyber threats, reduce attack surfaces, and enhance incident response.

## Key Features
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Limited lateral movement within the network.
- **Continuous Authentication**: Real-time risk assessments for user sessions.
- **Threat Modeling**: Simulated attack scenarios, including phishing and malware.

## Technologies Used
- Cloudflare Zero Trust
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Virtual Machines for simulated environments

## Outputs
- Comparative analysis report
- Recommendations for implementing ZTNA in modern IT infrastructures

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Review the `Simulation_Setup` folder for environment configuration files.
3. Check `Reports` for findings and insights.
